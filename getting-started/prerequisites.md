# Prerequisites

Static Site Boilerplate assumes that you have the following software packages installed on your machine:

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

{% hint style="info" %}
Feel free to install these packages using the method of your choice. Personally, I recommend [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows.
