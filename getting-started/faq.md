# FAQ

## Why use Grunt and not Webpack?

Webpack is an excellent tool in its own respect. However, Grunt is a bit more transparent, arguably easier to understand and overall the perfect tool for old school static site development, while still being able to support modern technologies such as PostCSS and ES6.

## Where aren't there any default styles or templates?

We keep our opinions to ourselves. Write your code however youâ€™d like, then generate a ready to deploy website with a single command. 

However, I do plan to offer guides to integrate frameworks such as Bootstrap. If there's something you'd like to see, feel free to [post a ticket here](https://github.com/ericalli/static-site-boilerplate/issues).
