# Everything Else

## .gitignore

The Static Site Boilerplate includes a project-level `.gitignore`. This is primarily used to avoid certain project-level files and directories from being included in source control.

## .editorconfig

The `.editorconfig` file is provided in order to encourage and help you and your team define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs.

By default, `.editorconfig` includes some basic [properties](https://editorconfig.org/#supported-properties) that reflect the coding styles from the files provided by default, but you can easily change them to better suit your needs.
