# JavaScript

Static Site Boilerplate includes a single JavaScript file located in the `src/js/` directory:

* [scripts.js](https://github.com/ericalli/static-site-boilerplate/blob/master/src/js/scripts.js) - By default, no JavaScript code is included as this boilerplate makes no assumptions as to how you should write your JavaScript. 

## Writing ES6

Static Site Boilerplate supports [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) JavaScript. In order for your ES6 code to be transformed for browser compatibility, simply create a new JavaScript file in the `src/js/` directory and name it whatever you'd like and end with the extension of `.es6.js`

## Source Maps

Source maps will be generated for debugging when running the local development server or after running `npm run build:dev` to generate a development build of your website.
