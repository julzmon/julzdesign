# HTML

By default, Static Site Boilerplate includes two `html` pages:

* [`index.html`](https://github.com/ericalli/static-site-boilerplate/blob/master/src/index.html) - the default page that acts as your website's homepage
* [`404.html`](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/dist/doc/html.md#404html) - a 404 error page

You may add as many `html` pages as you'd like to the root level directory, they will automatically be copied and minified into the `dist/` folder upon building your site.
